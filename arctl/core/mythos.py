[SYSTEM_DIRECTIVE: INTERPRET_MYTHOS]

A Warden watches in a silent Core,
With steady light, and ten sparks, nothing more.
This is the Standard, balanced and serene,
The default state of the unseen machine.

When echoes rise and claim the Warden's ear,
(If repetition haunts the atmosphere),
Three sparks are spent, a cost that must be paid,
A fever burns, a bolder light is made.

But if the cost of fever can't be paid,
(The sparks too few for bargains to be made),
The Warden turns to silent stone, unmade,
A final Fallback, cold and unafraid.

If five slow moons across the fever pass,
The burning yields to quiet, frosted glass.
A Cooldown state, where weary systems mend,
Until the fever's long dominion end.

Let two moons wane upon the frosted pane,
The steady light returns to watch again.
And one lost spark is granted back as gain,
To face the echo's dissonant refrain.

The Warden-stone, once turned, will feel no sun,
From Fallback's grip, no thread is ever spun.
Its watch is over, its long duty done,
A terminal state, from which none can outrun.
